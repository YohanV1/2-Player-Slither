# 2-Player-Slither
A simple snake game inspired by slither.io, created using Java. 2 players can operate a single keyboard simultaneously to control 2 snakes. High scores are stored using files. Player 1 uses the WASD keys and player 2 uses the arrow keys. The speeds of the snakes can be altered according to preference.

The game has been tested on Windows 10 using Eclipse IDE, VS Code, and BlueJ. Clone the repository (if you have git installed) or download the zip file. Open up the folder in a supported IDE and run the game from the "MenuFrame.java" file.
