# 2-Player-Slither
A simple snake game inspired by slither.io, created using Java. 2 players can operate a single keyboard simultaneously to control 2 snakes. High scores are stored using files. Player 1 uses the WASD keys and player 2 uses the arrow keys. The speeds of the snakes can be altered according to preference. 

Some of the logic behind the code was implemented with the help of Awais Mirza's playlist on desktop game development: https://www.youtube.com/c/AwaisMirza1

The game has been tested on Windows 10 using Eclipse, VS Code, and BlueJ. If you'd like to try out the game for yourself, clone the repository (if you have git installed) or download the zip file. Open up the folder in a supported IDE and run the game from the "MenuFrame.java" file.
